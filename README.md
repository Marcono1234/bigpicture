# jzy3d-bigviz
Drawing BigData Charts

The aim of this library is to provide connectors to big data tools (Spark, Hive, etc) to easily render large scatters, lines, surfaces in 2d or 3d charts relying on OpenGL rendering.

Jzy3d, based on JOGL, enables Java applications to use OpenGL to make best usage of computer's GPU capabilities (speed, memory).
